# 05-Sorting

In this assignment, you will practice sorting numbers in different ways. You will start by sorting two numbers, then move on to sorting three numbers, and finally, find the maximum number in an array.

**Do not use any built-in functions or libraries for sorting.**

## Part 1: Sorting Two Numbers

1. Create a new Swift file called SortTwoNumbers.swift.
2. Write a function called sortNumbers(a: Int, b: Int) -> (Int, Int) that takes in two arguments, a and b. The function should return a tuple of the two 3. numbers in ascending order.
4. Test your function by calling it with different pairs of numbers and printing out the result. Make sure the function is working correctly. Do not include the code of this part in your final submission

## Part 2: Sorting Three Numbers
1. Create a new Swift file called SortThreeNumbers.swift.
2. Write a function called sortNumbers(a: Int, b: Int, c: Int) -> (Int, Int, Int) that takes in three arguments, a, b, and c. The function should return a tuple of the three numbers in ascending order.
3. Do not use the function from part one.
4. Test your function by calling it with different sets of three numbers and printing out the result. Make sure the function is working correctly. Do not include the code of this part in your final submission

## Part 3: Finding the Maximum Number in an Array
1. Create a new Swift file called FindMaxNumber.swift.
2. Write a function called findMax(numbers: [Int]) -> Int that takes in one argument, numbers, which is an array of numbers. The function should return the maximum number in the array.
3. Test your function by calling it with different arrays of numbers and printing out the result. Make sure the function is working correctly.
